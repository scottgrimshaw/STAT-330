# we observe today

# Research Task: Predict Future Values
# Data Features: Time Series, Correlation observed in past is expected to continue next 5 years

# Analysis Weaknesses: No examination of "why" ... that is, no explanatory variables


# Challenge (another research task and find data):
#   predict annual visitors at the Lincoln Memorial for the next 5 years
#   data at https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park

#   another research task would be predicting the # of malaria cases in Panama for the next 10 years 
#   data from WHO (2000-2014) at http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1364?lang=en
